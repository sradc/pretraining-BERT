# pretraining-BERT

This accompanies the blog post: [sidsite.com/posts/bert-from-scratch](https://sidsite.com/posts/bert-from-scratch/)

See the pretraining code in [pretraining_BERT.ipynb](./pretraining_BERT.ipynb).

## Fine-tuning

It's possible to fine tune a model after pretraining, using the `run_finetuning.sh` script. Note that the parameters here are roughly based on [Cramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14034), but I used different training parameters for two of the tasks. (TODO: add these.))
